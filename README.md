# eap-microprofile-test-suite
 a small standalone test suite for MicroProfile on WF/EAP

## Requirements for the testsuite
 - JDK 8+
 - Docker
 
 Maven is not a hard requirement as `mvnw` is delivered with this repository.

 Podman with docker command bridge can be used as a Docker alternative or you can use a system property `-Ddocker.command=podman`.

## Run the testsuite
```
mvn clean verify

./mvnw clean verify
```

## Export testing deployments
```
mvn clean verify -Darquillian.deploymentExportPath=target/deployments/

./mvnw clean verify -Darquillian.deploymentExportPath=target/deployments/
```

## Run one module against custom build
```
mvn clean verify -pl microprofile-health -am -Djboss.dist=/Users/rsvoboda/Downloads/wildfly-18.0.0.Final

./mvnw clean verify -pl microprofile-health -am -Djboss.dist=/Users/rsvoboda/Downloads/wildfly-18.0.0.Final
```

## Run one module against running server
```
mvn clean verify -pl microprofile-health -am

./mvnw clean verify -pl microprofile-health -am
```
Please note `allowConnectingToRunningServer` property in `arquillian.xml`.

## Run the testsuite on Jenkins instance using Jenkinsfile:

- Follow instructions on <https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/> to install and run Jenkins
- Install `Pipeline` and `AnsiColor` plugins - see https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/ for more details
- Create a new `pipeline` job (`New Item` -> Choose `Pipeline` option and enter job name `microprofile-test-suite`)
- Copy content of Jenkinsfile into Pipeline script section and `Save`
    - Change `linux` label in `agent { label 'linux' }` to contain label assigned to your slaves
    - Change `java-1.8.0-oracle` in `jdk 'java-1.8.0-oracle'` to installed JDK label
- Trigger build by `Build Now` button - NOTE FIRST RUN WILL FAIL DUE TO ISSUES <https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40574/> <https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41929> but all the subsequent runs will work

## Quick compilation of the code
Can be used to ensure code changes are compilable, `-Djboss.dist=foo` is workaround to skip unpacking of WildFly zip.
```
mvn clean verify -DskipTests -DskipITs -Djboss.dist=foo

./mvnw clean verify -DskipTests -DskipITs -Djboss.dist=foo
```

## Target distributions and MicroProfile specs

The default Maven behavior when running the above mentioned commands will be to 
execute the test suite with its default settings - 
i.e. being about MicroProfile, this resolves to the assumption that:

* all of the MicroProfile specs modules test cases should be executed
* if a server instance must be started up then the `standalone-microprofile.xml`
 configuration should be used.

What described above would fit in the scenarios of Wildfly (which includes all 
of the MP specs since v. 19.0.0.Final) and EAP XP server distributions.

When it comes to the standard EAP stream bits tests, then the test suite 
behavior should be different. 
Specifically, only the test cases belonging to the modules which relate to 
those MicroProfile specs which constitute the so called `Observability layer`
should be executed and the `standalone.xml` file should be used when starting 
the server instance up.

The MicroProfile `Observability layer` specs include:
* MicroProfile Config
* MicroProfile Metrics
* Microprofile Health
* MicroProfile OpenTracing (no tests in here for this one)

In order to test the _just_ this reduced set of MicroProfile specs, then, an 
additional property should be provided to the command lines described earlier, 
namely `-Dmp.specs.scope=observability`.
In such case Arquillian will use the standard `standalone.xml` configuration 
file, too.
Consequently, the command lines described earlier and adjusted would be 
translated into the following variations:

### Quick compilation
```
mvn clean verify -DskipTests -DskipITs -Djboss.dist=foo -Dmp.specs.scope=observability

./mvnw clean verify -DskipTests -DskipITs -Djboss.dist=foo -Dmp.specs.scope=observability
```

### To run tests against a running server instance (let's suppose that who started it up knew which config file to use...):
```
mvn clean verify -pl microprofile-health -am -Dmp.specs.scope=observability

./mvnw clean verify -pl microprofile-health -am -Dmp.specs.scope=observability
```

### To run tests against against a custom build:
```
mvn clean verify -Djboss.dist=/Users/rsvoboda/Downloads/wildfly-18.0.0.Final -Dmp.specs.scope=observability

./mvnw clean verify -Djboss.dist=/Users/rsvoboda/Downloads/wildfly-18.0.0.Final -Dmp.specs.scope=observability
```

## Zip distribution bundle
Distribution bundle contains this testsuite, pre-loaded local maven repository and dump of Docker images used in tests.
Creation of the `eap-microprofile-test-suite-dist.zip` bundle is managed via `./mp-ts.sh` script.
This script assumes that all the necessary artifacts present in `${user.home}/.m2/repository/`, in other words that the TS was compiled and executed on local machine prior the bundle creation.

Bundle creation:
```
./mp-ts.sh dist-zip
```

Execution on target machine:
```
unzip -q eap-microprofile-test-suite-dist.zip
./mp-ts.sh dist-run
```
Tests output is redirected into `${TEST_FQCN}-output.txt` files in `target/surefire-reports/` directory.

For more details consult with `mp-ts.sh` script

## Code format and imports order
Code gets formatted and imports ordered during the build time (process-sources phase) automatically.

```
mvn process-sources

./mvnw process-sources
```

## Tagging and branching strategy

#### Version policy

Naming convention: `$MAJOR.$MINOR.$MICRO.Final-SNAPSHOT` (`1.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT`)

Start with `1.0.0.Final`

#### Tagging policy

Naming convention: `$MAJOR.$MINOR.$MICRO.Final` (`1.0.0.Final`)

###### When?

New WildFly major version is released and covers a MicroProfile update

#### Branching policy

Naming convention: `$MAJOR.$MINOR.z` (`1.0.z`)

###### When?

No branches unless really needed

### How to release a new version

```
mvn release:prepare release:clean
```

In order to skip tests run following command:

```
mvn release:prepare release:clean -Darguments=-DskipTests
```

With commands you are able to define a release, a tag and a next development version name in interactive way.

## Issues found by the testsuite
Any issue found in WildFly/EAP release will be reported into the Red Hat issue tracker: https://issues.redhat.com/ . There are the following Jira projects:
* https://issues.redhat.com/projects/WFWIP - for issues in unreleased WildFly version (like WF dev branches)
* https://issues.redhat.com/projects/WFLY - for released WildFly versions
* https://issues.redhat.com/projects/JBEAP - for released EAP versions

Every reported issue must contain:
* Title (affected MP spec may be part of the title, proper Component must be set)
* Type: Bug
* Component: related Microprofile component (`mp-health`)
* Affected Version - WildFly/EAP version (for WFLY/JBEAP issues)
* Description of the issue
  * provide high-level description of the issue
  * information about tested WF/EAP build (or used commit/branch)
  * impact on the user
  * test scenario (actual and expected result)
  * add logs/stacktraces
  * automatic reproducer (if possible)
